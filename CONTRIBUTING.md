## âœ‹ Before you start

Before you begin experimenting with the Design System site it is recommended that you undertake the [Cuttlebelle tutorials](https://cuttlebelle.com/documentation/). These will give you a good idea on how to create new pages and layouts.

## Content changes

We use a static site generator called [cuttlebelle](https://cuttlebelle.com/). This means that all of the content in our site lives in markdown files.

To contribute content we recommend first editing the files in the [content folder](https://github.com/designsystemau/design-system-site/tree/master/content).

## Installing design system locally

If youâ€™d like to contribute code, first, you will need to run design system locally.

ðŸ’¡ Building the design system is only necessary if you want to contribute to it.

```shell
npm install
npm run watch
```
