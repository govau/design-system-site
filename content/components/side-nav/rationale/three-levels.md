Each level in the side nav needs to be easily visually identifiable as a new level. Beyond 3 levels, visual solutions quickly become too complex or drastically reduce the available line length for links.

After reviewing multiple government and private sector websites, it was found that the upper extent of complex navigation solutions tended to be around 5 levels. To avoid overly complex user interfaces the navigation is often split into groups.

Typically:

- 2 levels in the main navigation, and
- 3 levels in the side navigation.

These can be supported by listing or landing pages if more levels are required.
