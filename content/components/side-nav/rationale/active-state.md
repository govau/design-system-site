The active state is intended to show which page the user is currently on. It uses a bold/strong style (that is, something other than colour) in order to meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Success Criterion 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html).
