heading: Maximum width paragraphs
---

Paragraphs are given a maximum width inside body to optimise readability across multiple lines of text. [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/) that lines of text do not exceed 80 characters in length.

[This option](https://github.com/designsystemau/design-system-components/blob/master/packages/core/src/sass/_globals.scss#L737) can be overwritten by changing the `AU-maxwidth` however it is not recommended.
