heading: Maximum width paragraphs
---

Paragraphs are given a maximum width inside body to optomise readability across multiple lines of text. [WCAG recommendeds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/) that lines of text do not exceed 80 characters in length.

[This option](https://github.com/govau/uikit/blob/master/packages/core/src/sass/_globals.scss#L737) can be overwritten by changing the `AU-maxwidth`however it is not recommended.
