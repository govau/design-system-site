## Released

Each released component includes information to help you implement them, such as:

- an explanation of the problem it solves in the interface
- live examples so you can see the component in action
- best practice and guidelines to use the component correctly

You can find comprehensive instructions on how to use the released components in our GitHub repo. Or search our FAQs in the Community forum.
