layout: component/rationale.js
heading: First and last pagination items always visible
---

By design the first and last items in the pagination list will always be visible where applicable.

Showing the last item in the pagination list enables the end user to know the limit of the pagination and how many pages of results are present. Showing both the first and last items upfront provides the user with a quick way to navigate to either of these options with needing to use the `Previous` and `Next` keys.
