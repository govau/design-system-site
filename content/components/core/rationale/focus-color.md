The original focus colour was orange as this provided a largest difference between the blue of the action colour. The orange used had to meet colour contrast and was quite dark and similar to red. This colour used caused issues with [form validation appearance](https://github.com/designsystemau/design-system-components/issues/306) as it looked too visually similar. We have since changed the focus colour to a purple as it can not be confused with red or green form state options.
