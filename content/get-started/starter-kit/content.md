We have created a starter kit with templates that can get you up and running with the design system. You can view the [live version](https://govau.github.io/design-system-starter/) or go to the [starter kit GitHub repository](https://github.com/govau/design-system-starter) to download the code.

The starter kit requires Node.js version 8 or higher. See the [Node.js/npm installation guides](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#install-npm--manage-npm-versions) if you require assistance installing node.

1. [Download the starter kit](https://github.com/govau/design-system-starter/archive/master.zip)

1. In terminal open this folder and run `npm install`. This will install dependencies necessary for the local development environment.

1. You can now start your local server by running `npm run watch`. This will check for file changes, when it occurs the server will build your site refresh the browser.


## How it works

In your directory you have a `package.json` file. This file points to dependencies that are installed when `npm install` is run. When you run `npm install` all of the design system components and additional packages related to the local development environment are added to the `node_modules/` folder.

When the user runs `npm run build` or `npm run watch` we use [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to convert the `src/sass/main.scss` file into the `docs/css/main.css` file. [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) is run after compilation to add vendor prefixes to the `main.css` file.

> Refer to the `package.json` scripts for how this has been set up

This set up allows you to modify the variables in the design system file from the `main.scss` file. You can [add your own colour scheme](/get-started/customise-colour), or [change the typography and spacing](/get-started/font-size-space). Tweaks to the components or additional ones should be added below the import of `_auds.scss` in the `main.scss` file. Changes to these files will be injected into your browser so you donâ€™t even need to refresh thanks to [Browser Sync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

The `docs` folder contains all the files required to publish a website. The `index.html` file references the `main.css` file and `script.min.js` assets to generate the page. We name the folder `docs` because [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses the docs folder to host static websites.

To start using other components you can copy paste the [HTML code snippets](/components) from the documentation into the `index.html` or other `html` file that you may have created.
