NPM (node package manager) is a package manager for Node based projects. NPM comes pre-installed with Node. 

The Design System components require Node version 8 or higher. See the [Node/NPM installation guides](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#install-npm--manage-npm-versions) if you require assistance installing node.

[Skip to step 3](#3-install-design-system-components) if you are adding the design system to an existing `npm` project.


## 1. Set up project folder

Create a new folder for the project, e.g. `design-system-starter`.


## 2. Initialise npm

To install the components through npm, you must have a `package.json` file in your project folder. This file holds the projects configuration, scripts and package versions. Find out more about the `package.json` file on the [NPM documentation website](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json). 

To create a `package.json` file open your command line in the project folder and run `npm init -y`. This will create a package.json based off the folder you are in. 

If you would like more control of the creation of the file you can run `npm init` and follow the prompts.

Once this is done the folder should now look like:

```
design-system-starter/
└─ package.json
```

The package.json file should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "design-system-starter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```


## 3. Install the components

Individual components can be installed via the command line using `npm install`. When `npm install` is ran it adds the component code to the `node_modules` folder.

The component name and version is also added to our list of dependencies in the `package.json` file. Let's start by installing the body, header and accordion components.

```bash
npm install --save @gov.au/body @gov.au/header @gov.au/accordion
```

> View the [full list of components](https://designsystem.gov.au/components)

Now that the components have been installed your folder should look like:
```
design-system-starter
├─ package-lock.json
├─ package.json
└─ node_modules/@gov.au
  ├─ accordion
  ├─ animate
  ├─ body
  ├─ core
  ├─ header
  └─ ...
└─ pancake
  ├─ css
  ├─ js
  ├─ react
  └─ sass
```


### Node modules

Each dependency ( in the `package.json` file ) is installed into the `node_modules` folder. If a component requires another component or library that dependency will also be installed.


### Pancake

[Pancake](https://github.com/govau/pancake) is a dependency of all of the components in the Australian Government Design System. It will check `peerDependencies` for conflicts and has plugins to compile the contents of your components ( e.g. sass -> css ).

You can read more about the [different settings](https://github.com/govau/pancake#local-settings) in the Pancake GitHub repository.

You can change the location and file name of autogenerated files for example `pancake/sass/pancake.scss` is generated from this code in the `package.json` file. 
```json
"pancake": {
  "sass": {
    "modules": false,
    "location": "pancake/sass/",
    "name": "pancake.scss"
  },
}
```

## 4. Create a page

Start by adding an `index.html` file to the project folder. Inside the file we need to add:
- Styles for the components
- JavaScript for any advanced components ( e.g. components that open and close )
- HTML5 and media query support for IE8
- `.no-js` class and script that removes the class when JavaScript is enabled
- Classes in the `<html>` tag for legacy browsers
- Some HTML example components

Here is an example HTML file to get started:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
  <html class="no-js lt-ie8 lt-ie9" lang="en">
<![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]>
  <html class="no-js lt-ie9 ie8" lang="en">
<![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 9 ]>
  <html class="no-js ie9" lang="en">
<![endif]-->
<!--[if !(IE)]><!-->
  <html class="no-js" lang="en">
<!--<![endif]-->
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Design system starter</title>
  
  <!-- Removes the no-js class on the <html> tag -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var $html = document.documentElement; if ($html.classList) $html.classList.remove("no-js"), $html.classList.add("js"); else { var className = "no-js"; $html.className = $html.className.replace(new RegExp("(^|\\b)" + className.split(" ").join("|") + "(\\b|$)", "gi"), " "), $html.className += " js" }
  </script>

  <!-- HTML5 and media query support for IE8, we recommend inserting these inline -->
  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/master/dist/html5shiv.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottjehl/Respond/master/dest/respond.min.js">
    </script>
  <![endif]-->

  
  <!-- Component styles -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="pancake/css/pancake.min.css">
</head>
<body>
 
  <!-- An example component -->
  <section class="au-accordion">
    <a href="#accordion-default" class="au-accordion__title js-au-accordion" aria-controls="accordion-default" aria-expanded="true" aria-selected="true" role="tab" onclick="return AU.accordion.Toggle( this )">Wuhuu design system</a>
    <div class="au-accordion__body" id="accordion-default">
      <div class="au-accordion__body-wrapper">
        And it looks good 😉
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
 
  <!-- Component javscript -->
  <script src="pancake/js/pancake.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

To start using other components you can install them and copy paste the [HTML code from the documentation](https://designsystem.gov.au/components/).
