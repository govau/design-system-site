## Governance

The design system team regularly gets asked about our governance model. We’ve previously published contribution guides, but it’s now time to share slightly more formally about how the system is funded, managed and coordinated as it moves into the next stage of its lifecycle and we make the transition from a centralised team to a federated one.

A working draft of our governance model has been written and is available [here](https://community.digital.gov.au/t/updating-our-governance-model/2596) - it aims to clearly answer common governance FAQs and ensure other teams can clearly see how the DTA is planning to maintain the product long-term. Feel free to provide your feedback directly by responding to the thread.
