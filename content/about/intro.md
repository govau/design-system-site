The Design System is a living, continually evolving set of tools. The design system unites teams that create digital services, through inclusive design, open-source code and shared insights. Our development priorities are guided by the community.

The design system has undergone a lot of changes since its inception. The principles and governance model that drives the development of the design system is detailed below. 

If you have any suggestions or feedback, we would love for you to get in touch with us.
